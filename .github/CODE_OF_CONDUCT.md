# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and compassionate environment, we as contributors and maintainers of H.A.AI pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free, respectful experience for everyone.

This is especially important given our project's mission: helping people struggling with loneliness, anxiety, and social isolation. We recognize that mental health is a sensitive topic, and we commit to treating all discussions with empathy, respect, and care.

## Our Values

H.A.AI is built on these core principles, which guide our community interactions:

1. **Compassion First**: We approach every interaction with empathy, recognizing that many contributors and users may be personally affected by mental health challenges.

2. **Privacy is Sacred**: We protect user privacy absolutely. Sharing, discussing, or joking about private conversations is strictly forbidden.

3. **Non-Exploitative**: We oppose the commercialization of loneliness and mental health struggles. This project exists to help people, not profit from them.

4. **Inclusive and Accessible**: We welcome contributors of all skill levels, backgrounds, and experiences.

5. **Ethical AI Development**: We commit to responsible AI development that respects human dignity and autonomy.
