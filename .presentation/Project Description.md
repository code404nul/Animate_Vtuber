### Project Description

Every year, anxiety and depression affect more than 359 million people around the world. When you can’t express what’s wrong, or when you can’t speak at all because of fear of rejection, there’s H.A.AI.E (Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Empathy).

H.A.AI.E isn’t designed to replace people. Its role is to be like that stuffed toy or imaginary friend you once shared your secrets with, helping you relearn how to communicate, understand others, and socialize again.

H.A.AI.E works completely offline. It uses a carefully trained local language model based on anonymized discussions from Discord and Reddit. It features advance emotion recognition, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech modules to create natural and empathetic conversations. A classification system helps the AI pick responses based on emotional tone. A Live2D Vtuber avatar adds a real touch with real-time lip-syncing and expressions.

The project’s local setup ensures privacy, no data collection, and no monetization of user emotions. Built with open-source tools like Whisper, Transformers, and Piper, H.A.AI.E aims to offer emotional support and help users practice genuine communication.

Its primary goal is simple yet essential: to guide users back to real human connection because your loneliness should never be a product.
